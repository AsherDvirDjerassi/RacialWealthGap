# RacialWealthGap

This repo includes two csvs (scf.csv and forbes_400.csv) and a R file (Racial Wealth Gap Vizualization.R) that creates several visualizations in highcharteR â€“ a R package that serves as a wrapper for highcharts.js. 

These visualization are outputted as HTML documents. There are two visualizations: 1) a visualization of overall wealth inequality in the US in 2019 and 2) a visualization of racial inequality in the US. 

The second visualization is actually a set of 6 prototype figures that are linked together. A user may navigate to all 6 figures through hyperlinks embedded in each visualization.
